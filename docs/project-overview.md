## 📚 Overview

This platform allows authenticated ACME employees to:
- ✅ Create and manage fundraising campaigns
- ✅ Donate to causes created by fellow employees
- ✅ View real-time progress and analytics via a rich dashboard

The backend provides a clean, well-documented RESTful API while also serving modern Vue-based SPA views via Inertia.

## 🧠 Architecture Decisions

### 🔁 Unified Controller API + View Responses
- Controllers like `CampaignController` respond with either JSON or Inertia views based on `request()->wantsJson()`.
- Eliminates duplicate logic across API and web interfaces.
  
### 🧩 Contracts & Bindings
- Payment logic is abstracted via `PaymentGatewayInterface` to allow last-minute gateway choice (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- Easily mockable for tests.
