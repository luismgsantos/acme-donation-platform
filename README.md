# ACME Donation Platform
## üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/luismgsantos/acme-donation-platform.git
```
2. Install PHP dependencies
```bash
composer install # This is necessary to later have ./vendor/bin/sail to run `./vendor/bin/sail up -d`
```
> **_NOTE:_** You can kind of skip this and just run `docker compose up -d` and then you have to install php dependencies, build the assets and run the migrations on your own with `php artisan migrate`.

3. Install and build frontend assets
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
